# Plan tracker — single source of truth for plan status

**Created:** 2026-08-18 · **Pruned:** 2026-09-05 (owner decision: shipped
history lives on disk under `docs/archive/plans/`, not in this file).
**Status enum:** `proposed | approved | in-progress | shipped | archived`.
The tracker is authoritative when a plan doc's `**Status:**` drifts.

**Active P23/P24 direction:** [Unified Plan / 3D authoring addendum](2026-09-09-P23-P24-unified-plan-3d-authoring-addendum.md) (ratified 2026-09-09; existing statuses and gates unchanged). Pascal direct-reference harvest is closed; [P24 reconciliation sequence](2026-09-09-P24-reconciliation-sequence.md) is the active P24 planning route.

## Rules

1. **One flat namespace.** New top-level plans are
   `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-P<number>-<slug>.md` — the P-number is assigned on
   registration and written into the filename (e.g.
   `2026-08-18-P1-camera-overhaul.md`). No letter codes beyond the P-number.
   **Child-plan exception (2026-09-08):** child slice plans and umbrella-internal
   annexes may use parent-derived IDs — `P23.0`–`P23.9` style names and
   `P24A`-style labels — without consuming tracker P-numbers; only umbrella/
   top-level roadmap plans are registered in the Active table with a P-number.
2. **Numbers live in filenames and this tracker.** Sequential numbers
   (`P1`, `P2`, …) are assigned on registration and carried in the filename;
   this tracker is the register that owns them (status, depends-on, order)
   and never renumbers files. The renewal that created the tracker is an
   **unnumbered process row** (a tracker cannot number its own bootstrap).
3. **Dependencies by tracker number**, never by letter family.
4. **Archive on close.** When a plan ships, its doc moves to
   `docs/archive/plans/` and this tracker lists stubs for the **5 most recent
   archived artifacts only** (see `Archived plans`). Older history stays on
   disk, unlisted (owner decision 2026-09-05).
5. **Re-registration, not re-lettering.** Approved-but-unscheduled work keeps
   its content and gains a tracker number; that content lives **folded into
   the plan's umbrella doc**. Only shipped/superseded docs archive.
6. Execution order is **pinned in the table's depends-on column**, not implied
   by the numbers (registration order ≠ priority).
7. **No narrative in this tracker.** Rows and stubs stay one line each;
   shipped detail lives in the plan doc (archived on close), never here.
8. **Collapse on ship.** Archiving a doc and collapsing its Active row happen
   in the same edit — shipped rows never linger in the table.

## Progressive planning model (2026-09-08)

Roadmap tiers follow one structure — umbrella plan → targeted research / code
harvest / technical spike **where required** → implementation-ready child
slice plan → implementation:

- **Umbrella plans** define the durable product contract, architecture
  boundaries, slice order and evidence gates (WHAT/WHY/BOUNDARIES/ORDER/
  RESEARCH GATES/high-level acceptance).
- **Evidence artifacts** (code harvest, product/UX research, technical spike,
  feasibility investigation) answer what was learned; they inform
  implementation but never silently override umbrella product/architecture
  contracts — conflicts go to owner review.
- **Child slice plans** carry implementation detail. Existing implementation
  detail is preserved in child-plan seeds rather than discarded. Only
  implementation-ready child plans may proceed to implementation.

Evidence selection: do not reopen broad research when prior discovery already
selected the relevant references — use bounded capability-specific
harvest/recheck work. Do not impose research on slices whose implementation
uncertainty is already sufficiently resolved.

Maximum planning chain (avoid bureaucracy): umbrella → evidence artifact, only
if required → implementation-ready child plan → implementation. A child seed is
the preserved draft form of the future child plan, not an extra layer.

Child-plan status vocabulary (a child plan existing ≠ implementation-ready):

```text
seed — pre-evidence
seed — evidence pending
evidence complete — reconciliation pending
implementation-ready
in progress
shipped / archived
```

Applied: P23 umbrella + implementation-ready child plans P23.0–P23.9,
informed by completed H1/H2/H3/H5; H4 remains deferred until bounded
offset/trim/curve follow-up is actually scheduled. P23 proceeds independently;
the completed Pascal harvest is optional bounded evidence, not an execution
gate. P24 umbrella has the P24A annex as its child seed plus the active
[P24 reconciliation sequence](2026-09-09-P24-reconciliation-sequence.md);
Pascal direct-reference evidence is closed and P24 may reconcile in parallel
with P23, while P24 implementation remains dependent on the accepted P23
minimum. P25 umbrella forms child plans after its E-studies close.

## Model routing

Per-increment difficulty (1–100) and model routing live in the living
assessment doc — [`model-assessment.md`](model-assessment.md) — not in this
tracker. Update it as increments ship.
Policy rules:

- **DeepSeek V4 Flash substitution (2026-08-20):** Luna max ≈ DeepSeek V4
  Flash. Any increment rated at **Luna difficulty (any effort)** routes to
  **DeepSeek V4 Flash** — the Luna effort is retained as the capability
  reference, not replaced. Sol tiers unchanged.
- **Never route to Terra (all efforts) or Sol low** — dominated points on the
  cost/intelligence frontier.
- **Escalate by evidence, not habit:** start at the cheapest tier clearing the
  required index; escalate one tier on a demonstrated capability failure,
  sending the stronger model the original failure state (not a summary).
- **Margin** = chosen tier index − required index. Margin 0 → escalate on
  first failure; don't pre-pay.
- Adjacent tiers differ 2–8% capability for 1.3–2.6× per-task cost — pay the
  jump only when the threshold matters.

**Pending archival (live files for shipped work — not tracked rows; owner follow-up):**

- Done 2026-09-05: P7 umbrella + P7.6 annex + P8 umbrella moved to
  `docs/archive/plans/` (moved as a set — the annex link at umbrella `:1179`
  is relative and survives); byte-identical P11.2 annex deleted (archive holds
  the copy); 0-byte P12.2 live husk deleted (archive holds the content).
- Reconcile-then-delete (live copy has **diverged** from the archived copy —
  diff before dropping either side): `2026-08-18-P1-camera-overhaul.md`.
  Done 2026-09-08 (P22 closeout cleanup): reconciled — the archived copy holds
  the evolved record (review amendments F1–F7, shipped status, compressed §D);
  the live copy's 366 diverged lines were all pre-review text §D/F2 had
  replaced with pointers. Live husk deleted; archive copy is canonical.
  Also removed the `2026-08-29-backend-persistence-migration-review.md`
  pointer husk (archive copy confirmed present, zero live inbound links).
- Done 2026-09-05: `hand-off/designer-context-packet.md` moved to
  `docs/archive/designer-context-packet-2026-09-03.md` (one-off 2026-09-03
  packet; its output already landed as the P21.5 brief; `hand-off/` holds
  `CURRENT.md` only per the folder map).
- Done 2026-09-05: superseded `Design-specs/Camera-plan-objects-brief.md`
  moved to `docs/archive/plans/`, stub left behind pointing at frozen
  `Camera-layout-design.md`.
- Done 2026-09-08: P19 umbrella + P19.4 annex, P20 umbrella + S2/S3/S4 briefs,
  and the P21 set (umbrella + P21.4 + P21.5 + P21.6 + slice-2B annex) moved to
  `docs/archive/plans/` as sets at P21 closeout (cross-links survive — each
  set's relative links stay inside the set, same as the P7 precedent).

## Gate status

Ship narrative for P1–P21 (execution order, scope decisions, the P12/P3B hard
gate) now lives in the archived docs, not here.

- Next: P22 shipped 2026-09-08 (P22.1–P22.5 + hosted acceptance — production
  cold-browser loop through deployed proxy/API/Postgres/R2, anonymous
  release-membership boundary, shipped-static retention, full checks + route
  bundle gates green; public-route `untrack` fix deployed as `f46e8f3`);
  next is **P23 Foundation Gate F0**. P23 wall-first reconciliation was
  owner-ratified 2026-09-09 after H1/H2/H3/H5. F0 is one gate across P23.0 +
  P23.8: schema/compat scaffolding → topology/Room reconciliation →
  migration/compiler/editor-adapter cutover → compatibility acceptance →
  enable wall-first writers. Current product code remains Room-owned/Room-local
  until F0 ships. The Pascal harvest is closed optional evidence and does not
  delay F0 or any P23 child whose documented dependencies are otherwise met.
- Long-term tiers renumbered 2026-09-05 (owner): P23 Layout Depth, P24
  Scene/Staging Depth, P25 Experience Foundation, P26+ platform expansion;
  typed DB is conditional infrastructure, not a tier. Owner reconciliation
  2026-09-06: P23/P24 are staged (minimum useful slices first, optional
  depth tails later); P25 may follow the minima before the tails; a bounded
  agent/reuse proof follows the first complete visitor-authoring slice. P24
  umbrella registered 2026-09-08 with internal P24A asset-supply/canonical-
  ingest and P24B Rich Scene / Staging Authoring subtracks. Phase 2 was reviewed
  2026-09-08 and the detailed P24A annex is registered; Phase 4 compact research
  is reviewed directionally, and the Pascal direct-reference harvest is now
  closed. The active [P24 reconciliation sequence](2026-09-09-P24-reconciliation-sequence.md)
  runs current-code maturity audit → cross-view placement/selection contract →
  transform/material/light/environment reconciliation → B6 minimum freeze.
  P24 planning may run in parallel with P23, but P24 implementation remains
  dependent on P23 and any seam changed by F0 receives a targeted post-F0 recheck
  before implementation-ready child plans freeze. P25 umbrella registered
  2026-09-08 after Phase 5 external capability review; it remains research/
  reconciliation only until E0–E6 close. See Long-term roadmap.
- Deferred / non-blocking: P3B.7b (incl. the P3.4/P3.5 acceptance tail).
- Proposed / unscheduled: P13, branch rejoin.
- Shipped baseline: P12 + core P3B gate 2026-08-28; P14–P18 extraction slice;
  P19 live smoke 2026-09-03; P20 local-vs-R2 smoke 2026-09-04
  (production-topology smoke deferred); P21 acceptance gate 2026-09-08.

Older history — P14 and earlier, the letter-era A–H tracks, prior scope
decisions — lives on disk under `docs/archive/plans/` (renewal era) and
`docs/archive/plans/pre-h1-letters/` (letter era), unlisted by owner decision
2026-09-05. When a plan ships, its stub enters this list and the oldest stub
drops off (Rule 4).

## Long-term roadmap (registered plans above; future tiers are direction only)

Ratified 2026-08-31 with the north-star amendment: the project shell has two
primary creative modes — **Spatial** (the current editor) and **Experience**
(future) — plus project-level **Assets** and **Publish** surfaces, all
operating on one portable project truth. Direction lives in
[`../north-star.md`](../north-star.md) and its final conceptual hierarchy;
this section records the sequencing tiers. The Active table owns registered
P-numbers; future numbered tiers below are next-free-number reservations
(direction only) that become registered only when their plan docs are filed
(owner roadmap revised 2026-09-03; tiers renumbered 2026-09-05 — authoring
depth owns the P23/P24 slots, Experience moved to P25, typed DB demoted to
conditional infrastructure):

- **Now — Design track in parallel** (no P-number; design only — no major
  implementation yet): product flow / IA / shell / Hub / editor UX concepts
  running alongside the implementation tiers. Concepts and specs land in
  [`../Design-specs`](../Design-specs/); nothing commits to implementation
  until its plan doc is filed.
- **P20 — Project Asset Registry + R2.** Shipped 2026-09-04 (local live smoke
  vs real R2 passed; production-topology smoke deferred).
- **P21 — Product shell + Project Hub + core editor UX polish.** Shipped
  2026-09-08 (P21.1–P21.6 + final acceptance gate; see the archive).
- **P22 — Basic Publish + visitor runtime.** Registered above. Publish an owned project, resolve
  project assets, hosted visitor-safe output, and basic preview/publish
  status. Brief written assuming P21 complete (owner 2026-09-07); implementation
  depends on P21 closeout. Strategic rationale: P22 establishes the
  reusable execution target for every human- or agent-authored project
  (canonical project → deterministic asset resolution → cold visitor-safe
  runtime → published version → URL) while protecting visitor/editor
  isolation. The eventual proof is a cold boot in a fresh browser without
  `EditorApp`, editor stores, selection, history, gizmos, or editor-only
  asset setup. No Experience authoring, no agent API, no general Assets
  workspace, no collaboration, no generic SDK.
- **P23 — Layout Depth family (staged, wall-first reconciliation ratified
  2026-09-09).** The minimum useful Build set begins with a coupled Foundation
  Gate: first-class Junctions/Walls/Wall-hosted Openings; `boundary | partition`
  semantics; robust straight-wall topology and persistent Room correspondence;
  explicit Layout/Scene format compatibility; trustworthy legacy Room-frame
  conversion; project/world-local Scene/Camera physical placement; compiler/
  query/editor-adapter cutover; and old Save/Publish compatibility before new
  writers enable. It then adds precise Wall/Junction dimensions, deterministic
  snapping/alignment, continuous Wall/Partition sketching, openings, repeat/
  isolated-room duplicate, small presets and drafting visual polish. Layout
  objects stay document-level/project-world-local. Optional depth tail (stairs,
  railings, richer parametric components, curved-wall topology, profile/extrude,
  sweep/revolve, roof helpers, general constraint sophistication) remains
  demand/evidence-gated and never blocks Experience. Everything continues through
  one `LayoutDocument` → `compileLayoutGeometry()` → Plan/3D/visitor geometry
  authority, with Layout and Scene ownership kept separate. P23 implementation
  proceeds from its own umbrella/child dependencies; completed Pascal evidence is
  optional and should be read only for a materially overlapping slice, never as a
  prerequisite.
- **P24 — Scene / Staging Depth umbrella (registered, staged).** The umbrella
  is registered above and split internally into **P24A — Asset Supply +
  Canonical Ingest** and **P24B — Rich Scene / Staging Authoring**. Phase 2
  research is reviewed and P24A has a linked detailed annex. Its minimum
  proves a rights/provenance gate, deterministic canonical ingest, a bounded
  10–12 asset cross-source proof set (Poly Haven + Kenney + Sweet Home 3D),
  PlanProxy output into the existing `AssetFootprint`, an explicit canonical
  model Scene/Save/Load/P22 visitor-resolution path, and bounded material/HDRI
  supply. The research JSON's 32-object Wave 1 remains acquisition backlog,
  not a P24/P25 gate. P24B Phase 4 compact research is reviewed directionally;
  the pinned Pascal direct-reference harvest is closed and is now evidence,
  not another research gate. The active
  [P24 reconciliation sequence](2026-09-09-P24-reconciliation-sequence.md)
  runs R0–R9 over current Museum code: P23 delta map, P24A readiness, B0 maturity
  matrix, B2 shared Plan/3D placement, B5 cross-view behavioral contract, B1/B3/B4
  depth decisions, final B5 presentation, then B6 minimum freeze. P24 planning may
  run in parallel with P23; implementation still depends on P23, and seams changed
  by F0 get a targeted post-F0 recheck before implementation-ready child plans
  freeze. Material/texture/HDRI assets originate in P24A while assignment/editing/
  light/environment operations belong to P24B. Both preserve one project asset
  registry, `SceneDocument` ownership, canonical selection/history, existing
  gizmo/transform authority, Threlte patterns and visitor/editor isolation; they
  consume the spatial coordinate model shipped by P23. Current room-local
  transforms are pre-P23 baseline evidence, not a future P24 invariant. P25 waits
  only for the accepted useful minimum from both subtracks, never for catalogue/
  DCC depth tails. See [P24 umbrella](2026-09-08-P24-scene-staging-depth-umbrella.md),
  [P24A annex](2026-09-08-P24A-asset-supply-canonical-ingest-annex.md), and
  [P24 reconciliation](2026-09-09-P24-reconciliation-sequence.md).
- **P25 — Experience Foundation umbrella (registered, research/reconciliation).**
  Phase 5 external capability research is reviewed directionally. The leading
  hypothesis is **Destination + reusable Content + bounded semantic Interaction**,
  composed over existing Spatial/Camera/Assets meaning. The first guided journey
  should preferentially reuse the existing Camera Sequence; the strongest minimum
  event/action candidates are `Activate`, `DestinationReached`, `ShowContent`,
  `NavigateTo` and `OpenUrl`. Exact persistence ownership, Destination target
  semantics, repeated-Destination/occurrence behavior, Narration scope and schema
  remain unfrozen. E0–E6 in the [P25 umbrella](2026-09-08-P25-experience-foundation-umbrella.md)
  must reconcile live Camera/visitor behavior, Content/Interaction semantics,
  accessibility, authoring UX, Preview/Publish and persistence/operations before
  implementation tickets exist. P25 still begins after the accepted P23/P24
  useful minima, before optional depth tails, and must prove one complete
  visitor journey rather than a generic app-builder feature set.
- **Bounded agent/reuse proof (after first complete visitor-authoring
  slice, before broad expansion).** Test whether a strong agent can inspect,
  semantically edit, stage, author camera/experience changes, validate,
  preview, publish, and revise through the same canonical behavior as human
  authoring. Small useful operation set only; no custom planner, chat UI,
  generic agent framework, four transports, or large MCP surface. Transport
  stays replaceable per client need. Registered as its own brief when due;
  no P-number is consumed by this direction entry.
- **P26+ — Evidence-led platform expansion.** Later expansion arrives as
  several separately registered slices rather than one milestone, scheduled
  only against measured reuse/delivery/adoption needs: richer P23/P24/P25
  depth tails, templates / camera kits / provider adapters, richer asset
  workflows / My Assets, collaboration / teams, richer Publish / domains /
  embeds, runtime SDK / headless runtime. No permanent P-numbers now —
  direction until individual plan docs are filed, starting at P26.
- **Typed DB layer — conditional infrastructure, not a numbered milestone**
  (owner decision 2026-09-05, demoted from the former P23). A typed database
  layer (Drizzle/Kysely-style schema-owned types, typed query access) is
  adopted only when code pressure on the raw-parameterized-SQL surface from
  P19–P22 proves it — as a small technical slice inside or before a later
  tier, never as a product milestone owning a P-number. The P19/P20 no-ORM
  pins hold until then.
- **Cross-cutting planning rules (apply from P23 authoring work):**
  operation-first — UI is one client of domain behavior: separate semantic
  intent → validation → deterministic mutation → transaction/history →
  rendering from button/toolbar/gesture/Inspector presentation, extracting
  only the abstraction current code pressure justifies (see north-star
  Shared authoring operations). Validation/observability — establish
  domain-level checks incrementally as primitives grow (broken refs,
  constraint validity, room membership, route integrity, shot
  visibility/clipping, perf signals); structured facts first, render
  inspection as complement, no giant validator subsystem now.

- **Current / near-term platform work** (grounded in active rows): core
  extraction / app boundaries (P15–P17 shipped), backend provisioning (P18
  shipped), project Save/Load + first Google OIDC + app-owned secure-session
  integration + single-user ownership (P19 shipped 2026-09-03 — live smoke
  passed), then the numbered tier sequence above:
  R2-backed project assets with Spatial integration (P20, shipped 2026-09-04 —
  local live smoke vs real R2; production-topology smoke deferred), the
  product shell + Project Hub + editor UX polish (P21, shipped 2026-09-08 —
  P21.1–P21.6 plus the P21.5 presentation-only polish pass, closed by the
  six-reference + axe/contrast acceptance gate), the basic
  publish/visitor-runtime boundary (P22, shipped 2026-09-08 — the first
  complete product loop: author → preview → publish → visitor sees it, closed
  by hosted cold-boot acceptance through the deployed proxy/API/Postgres/R2),
  then minimum useful authoring
  slices split by document ownership (P23 Layout Depth minimum, P24 Scene /
  Staging minimum split internally into P24A asset supply/ingest + P24B Rich
  Scene / Staging Authoring), the registered P25 Experience research/
  reconciliation umbrella, a bounded agent/reuse proof, then evidence-led
  depth tails and expansion (P26+). The design track runs in parallel from Now.
  Auth UX/hardening and richer permissions ride with the P26+ collaborative
  tier, not P19/P20.
- **Medium-term product infrastructure** (possible direction, unscheduled):
  hosted project loading and published project versions ride with P22;
  portable project/export hardening, project asset management, and generic
  visitor/player extraction when genuinely needed.
- **Long-term Experience work** (unscheduled beyond the P25 foundation):
  Narration/transcripts, richer wayfinding, bounded first-visit state,
  semantic hotspots where no existing Scene identity exists, attention/reveal
  behaviors, deep-linked destinations, multiple tours/occurrence semantics,
  derived visitor maps, reusable Experience templates/presets, localization,
  analytics, richer visitor-state persistence, XR-specific behavior, developer
  runtime SDK, headless runtime, and community/gallery surfaces. Experience
  remains composed of **Navigation · Content · Interactions**; Interactions are
  an authoring lens within Experience (an `Event → Target → Action` semantic
  model), never a separate mode — ratified 2026-08-31
  ([scope decision](../archive/plans/2026-08-31-scope-decision-experience-interaction-boundary.md)).

Constraints: no Experience implementation tickets are created merely by
registering the P25 research umbrella, and Experience work must not displace
persistence or Spatial completion. `ExperienceDocument` is now a P25
architecture hypothesis to study, not a ratified schema: no codecs, migrations
or backend endpoints exist until the E6 implementation-ready gate closes. P19
includes the first Google OIDC (Authorization Code + PKCE) + app-owned
secure-session integration and single-user ownership required for Save/Load;
broader auth UX/hardening and richer permissions remain later. P19 has no
Experience schema and no R2.

P19–P22 stay raw parameterized SQL: the no-ORM pins in the P19/P20 plans are
scope-limited to those tiers and are revisited only when code pressure on
that surface justifies a typed layer — conditional infrastructure (owner
decision 2026-09-05), never a numbered milestone. P21/P22 hold no Experience
authoring or Experience schema; P25 schema/persistence ownership remains
unfrozen until the P25 E6 gate, and P25 may follow the accepted minimum P23/P24
slices without waiting for their optional depth tails. No Experience
implementation tickets or codecs are created by roadmap direction or external
research alone.
