# Shell and workspaces

**Read when:** app chrome, Scene/Camera switch, Layout mode, top bar, timeline frame, project menu.  
**Last reviewed:** 2026-09-03 (P20.2 + P21+ shell doc reconciliation)

**Current implementation status:** the pre-P21 stacked Project Shell scaffold
+ `EditorAppBar` remains in the tree (2026-09-03).
**P21+ target:** [`../Design-specs/Design-Plan(P21+).md`](../Design-specs/Design-Plan(P21+).md)
— target authority for product entry (`/`), Project Hub (`/projects`), Project
Shell chrome, Row 1 / Row 2 placement, persistence/account presentation, and
project-level Visitor Preview.

This file remains the **current implementation map**. Everything below
describes the tree as it exists today (pre-P21) unless explicitly marked as
P21+ target.

## Current implementation — pre-P21

```

The shell is a domain×view matrix over **one shared `Plan | 3D` view axis**
(P1.7): `Scene | Camera` switches domain; a `Plan | 3D` switch applies to
both domains; a domain switch never snaps the view (boot: Scene → Plan).
Domain changes are attention-only (not document/history/world); view changes
never change domain. Camera owns the same timeline state in Plan and 3D.

Viewport focus mode (P21.6 Slice C): independent left/right session booleans
plus a derived focus flag collapse the shell grid toward `0 1fr 0` — CSS
only, the canvas is never unmounted. Collapsed panels clip and go `inert`
with focus restored to the viewport; Row 2 Zone C, the View menu
(`Focus 3D (\)`), and the `\` shortcut drive it (relic excluded). Collapse
requests during a pointer-down gesture defer to one coalesced pending config
applied after commit/cancel + capture release; external resizes cancel the
gesture instead. Framing stays observer-relative: vertical FOV authored,
far-plane width derives from live viewport aspect.

Camera mounts the four-section `CameraSidebar` (Environment · Sequence
Inspector · Unsequenced · Connections). Environment is read-only. Per-camera
chevrons expose a component-local flat accordion of directly connected
Unsequenced sidequests; ordered Sequence neighbors are omitted, and there is
no standalone Neighbors section. Reorder remains drag-only. Scene 3D owns
`Hierarchy | Assets`. Scene-only tabs, Assets, and
Add Room never appear in Camera. No empty Camera rail mounts over the
viewport; workspace actions stay in the contextual viewport toolbar except
for the Camera Plan toolbar (P1.5), which owns Select/View, Add Camera,
Connect, and Grid/Snap.

**Camera → Plan (P1.5)** mounts over the architectural backdrop with its own
contextual toolbar (Select/View, Add Camera, Connect, Grid/Snap); the Plan
inspector becomes workspace-specific — world X/Z, flow order, per-direction
connection timing with Forward/Reverse + authored/automatic switching — while
Scene → Plan keeps its read-only gate for preserved scene/camera selections.
Behavior (gestures, hit priority, backdrop authority, timing authoring,
history rules) is canonical in [`camera-tour.md`](./camera-tour.md).

| Workspace | Preview |
|-----------|---------|
| Scene | Preview Scene → `/museum` (pre-P21 temporary) |
| Camera | Preview Camera → in-editor selected-camera view; Preview Edge and Preview Sequence remain contextual scopes |

> **Pre-P21 note:** `Preview Scene → /museum` is temporary pre-P21 behavior,
> not canonical target. The P21+ target is the project-level Visitor Preview
> takeover (`/project/:id/preview`) per
> [`Design-Plan(P21+).md`](../Design-specs/Design-Plan(P21+).md) §I.

Project menu: scene Import/Paste/Copy/Download/Reset + separate Layout JSON Import/Paste/Copy/Download/Reset section. Layout status + invalid-import feedback appear in menu, sidebar, inspector. Scene + layout replacement confirmations document-scoped; editor navigation + browser unload protect either dirty document. Undo/Redo enabled in Layout, shares one chronological stack with tagged scene/layout entries. Top-bar scene dirty badge scene-scoped. **No** automatic git Save.

Layout workspace chrome: viewport toolbar has Plan/3D, Select, Rect room, Polygon room, Plan Snap/Grid or 3D Ceiling controls. Plan Select room bodies move complete room units; selected rooms expose centroid rotation arm + Shift 15° snap. Right sidebar keeps layout status/counts visible, presents Place, Objects, Selection accordion sections; accordion state session-only. Room inspector rotation applies relative degrees, resets to zero.

Timeline: collapsed `48px`; default expanded `288px`, user range `240–300px`.
Expansion state persists verbatim and never auto-expands on a domain switch.
Display lanes: Camera Path · Shots · FOV · Look At · Roll. These project the
current two backing models (Guided Route + Camera Framing); P3 adds no new
Shots/Roll entities or independent raw curves. Expanded main-editor chrome has
a fixed `36px` header; collapsed chrome is an integrated `48px` temporal
mini-player. Expanded scrubbing belongs to the ruler/five-lane playhead surface,
not a second playback bar. Main-editor controls are Previous/Next camera-node
boundary, Play/Pause, POV/Observer, and Center/Follow; `+ View Key` appears only
for 3D Sequence. Scope changes are explicit, selection-only by default, and
main-editor Repeat/loop/distinct Replay controls do not exist.

Status bar is persistent and informational. Its save state aggregates scene
and layout dirtiness; Plan reads Plan grid/snap state and Plan navigation
hints, while 3D reads 3D grid/transform-snap state and 3D navigation hints.

## P21+ target

Summary of the ratified target (full detail in
[`Design-Plan(P21+).md`](../Design-specs/Design-Plan(P21+).md)):

```text
36px Project Row (Row 1)
+ 32px Workspace Ribbon (Row 2)
= 68px total persistent top chrome
status bar 24px
no permanent floating viewport toolbar
project-level Visitor Preview
```

- Row 1 hosts project identity, persistence, project navigation, the Undo/Redo
  slot, Visitor Preview, and account; Row 2 hosts `Scene | Camera`,
  `Plan | 3D`, and the active workspace's contextual authoring tools.
- The current floating/contextual toolbars relocate into Row 2; viewports keep
  only direct-manipulation fixtures.
- Undo/Redo in Row 1 binds the existing chronological tagged Scene/Layout
  history stack for Spatial; non-Spatial surfaces defer or disable the slot
  rather than sharing one universal cross-workspace undo.
- `Preview Scene → /museum` is a temporary pre-P21 behavior and is **not** the
  canonical target.
