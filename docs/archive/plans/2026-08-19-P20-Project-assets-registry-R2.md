# P20 — Project Asset Registry + R2 asset storage

**Status:** shipped 2026-09-04 — S0–S4 verified by local live smoke against
real R2 (`biskiq-assets-test`) + local Postgres. Deployed Render/Neon-topology
smoke not run — deferred.
**Depends on:** P19 shipped, including the live Google OIDC / deployed Save–Load gate.
**Source:** ratified backend/persistence migration review Pass 6 + current North Star shared-assets direction.
**Amended:** owner-ratified amendment direction (SceneDocument vs registry ownership, portable package semantics, shared-package purity, R2 test seam, key/dedup isolation, tightened v1 scope, targeted S0 inventory, S-slice naming) — S0 must resolve the durable texture-reference, cloud-Save durability, and guest-binary contracts before S1.
**Purpose:** add the first durable project-level asset system without introducing Experience, Publish, user-wide libraries, or a second scene/asset authority.

---

## Outcome

Turn project assets into durable cloud resources.

An authenticated owned project can ingest an asset, assign it stable project-level identity and metadata, store heavy bytes in Cloudflare R2 where required, reference that asset from the existing Spatial authoring system, Save the `ProjectDocument`, refresh/Load later, and resolve the same bytes again.

The durable flow becomes:

```text
Guest/local authoring
        ↓
authenticate + own project
        ↓
Project Asset Registry
        ↓
    ┌───┴────┐
metadata     bytes
Postgres      R2
        ↓
Spatial now
Experience later
```

P20 implements the registry for **current Spatial use**.

It does not implement Experience or Publish.

---

# Product contract

The project has **one asset registry**.

```text
Project Asset Registry
        ↓
   Spatial
        ↓
Experience later
```

Asset source is acquisition metadata, not a separate authoring system.

The broad source classes remain:

```text
Built-in
Upload
Online
```

Implementation forms may differ:

```text
built-in/procedural
→ metadata/reference only
→ no R2 object required

uploaded file
→ registry metadata
→ R2 bytes

online/provider import
→ registry metadata + provenance
→ R2 bytes when imported/copied into project storage
```

Do not force procedural or built-in semantic assets to pretend to be GLBs.

Do not create:

```text
SpatialAssetStore
ExperienceAssetStore
TextureCloudStore
ModelCloudStore
```

as competing durable systems.

---

# Current starting point

P20 begins after P19/P19.4 established:

```text
Entry
→ Project Hub
→ Project Shell
→ Spatial Editor
```

A guest can author without authentication.

An authenticated user owns durable cloud projects.

Cloud asset persistence therefore belongs only to an **authenticated owned project**.

Do not introduce anonymous database users or anonymous R2 ownership.

The current Spatial asset model already contains concepts such as:

```text
assetId
category
placementSurface
footprint
defaultScale
defaultRotation
fallback
source/provenance
license/attribution
productionFile
```

and scene placements already reference assets by `assetId`.

Current texture handling separately has local/package binary references. `projectExportBlocker` answers whether bytes are resolvable in the current browser session, not whether they are durable: `BinaryTextureStore` membership clears it, and cloud Save currently reuses it. A registered `/local/...` or package URI can therefore reach cloud JSONB and fail after refresh.

S0 must close this P19 holdover with a separate cloud-Save durability gate. Local/package URI forms remain blocked regardless of in-memory bytes until successful registry conversion replaces them with the canonical durable reference. Do not change the existing session-resolution/export predicate to carry both meanings.

P20 must reconcile these existing systems rather than placing a new registry alongside them.

---

# Architectural boundaries

## Postgres owns

Durable project asset identity and metadata:

```text
project association
stable asset identity
kind/category
storage kind
mime
byte size
SHA-256
R2 object reference when applicable
source/provenance
creator
license
attribution
provider/source reference
import state
created/updated metadata
```

The exact schema is decided in S0 after code inventory.

## R2 owns

Heavy immutable or replaceable binary resources such as:

```text
GLB/model bytes
textures
images
audio
video
other project media
```

R2 does **not** own semantic project structure.

The long-term registry remains broad (3D, images, audio, video, presentation media, provider imports). P20 implementation is intentionally narrow: **textures/images first** (`image/png`, `image/webp`, `image/jpeg`); GLB only if current code already has a viable import/placement path without a new subsystem; no audio/video pipelines. The design must not prevent those later.

## ProjectDocument owns

Semantic authored references to project assets where required by Scene/Material/etc.

It does not store:

```text
binary bytes
bucket
R2 key
R2 credentials
signed URLs
R2 implementation details
storage status
SHA dedup state
upload state
HTTP state
provider credentials
```

A Scene document may reference a project asset, but it must not become the asset registry.

## Shared-package purity

`@portfolio/project-model`, `@portfolio/layout-core`, and `@portfolio/camera-core` remain storage- and infrastructure-neutral. They must gain no dependencies on:

```text
R2
AWS SDK
S3
Fastify
pg
Node-only storage APIs
editor session state
```

Pure model changes required for durable semantic references are allowed. Storage implementation is not. The R2/S3 client belongs under `apps/api`; editor code consumes an authenticated API/resource-resolution seam, never an R2 SDK. This mirrors the existing P19 application-boundary rule. Add a static boundary guard (e.g. project-model must not import storage/server SDKs) alongside the visitor-bundle pin.

## Existing Spatial owners remain

P20 must not disturb:

* `LayoutDocument` / `SceneDocument` separation;
* room-local transforms;
* editor selection/history;
* layout compiler ownership;
* camera graph/motion authority;
* current Svelte 5 / Threlte lifecycle;
* whole-project P19 Save/Load semantics.

---

# Core invariant — authored references do not point at R2

Authored project state should reference stable asset identity, not physical object-storage location.

Preferred conceptual direction:

```text
Scene / Material
      ↓
project assetId
      ↓
Project Asset Registry
      ↓
storage metadata
      ↓
R2 object key
```

Never:

```text
SceneDocument
→ raw bucket name / R2 key / presigned URL
```

Storage layout may change without rewriting authored project truth.

## Durable-reference gate — SceneDocument vs Project Asset Registry ownership (blocks S1)

P20 must not proceed with the vague instruction:

```text
/local/... → durable asset reference
```

without defining what that reference means in the canonical project model. Current truth is `SceneTextureAsset = { id, name, uri }` with the shared scene codec accepting only a safe root-relative `uri`.

### Ownership rule

```text
Project Asset Registry
→ owns durable asset identity, provenance and storage metadata

SceneDocument
→ owns only the semantic reference required by the authored material/texture relationship

R2
→ owns bytes only
```

### S0 must choose one canonical representation

Inspect the current codec and loader and explicitly decide between:

**A. project-model schema change** — evolve texture references to distinguish a durable project asset from a legacy/static URI.

**B. app-local resolution over the existing URI model** — only if this preserves a meaningful portable semantic contract without treating an API/R2 URL as project truth.

Do not choose B merely to avoid a schema migration.

The detailed plan must answer:

1. What does a durable texture reference look like?
2. Does `@portfolio/project-model` change?
3. How do existing `{ id, name, uri }` documents continue to validate?
4. Is this a schema-version change or a backward-compatible extension (Scene currently has no version field)?
5. How does the editor resolve the reference?
6. How does visitor-safe/package resolution work?
7. What exactly replaces `/local/...` after successful cloud conversion?

Preferred principle:

```text
SceneTextureAsset
→ semantic project asset reference

Project Asset Registry
→ asset reference → storage metadata

API
→ storage metadata → R2
```

Never:

```text
SceneTextureAsset
→ R2 URL/key
```

If the current texture/schema model cannot adopt asset identity cleanly inside P20, the implementation plan may define a migration-safe intermediate representation, but must:

1. identify the debt explicitly;
2. preserve project-model validation;
3. avoid making R2 URLs canonical project identity.

---

# Main design decision — catalogue vs registry

This is P20's primary architecture gate.

The existing `Asset` type mixes several concerns:

### Catalogue / acquisition information

```text
sourceFile
productionFile
sourceUrl
creator
license
attribution
status
```

### Authoring semantics

```text
placementSurface
footprint
defaultScale
defaultRotation
fallback
shadow defaults
```

### Runtime/loading concerns

```text
productionFile
load/fallback behavior
```

P20 must not blindly serialize the whole current `Asset` object into Postgres.

The intended ownership is:

```text
Built-in catalogue / external provider
          ↓ ingest / accept
Project Asset Registry
          ↓
stable project asset
```

A catalogue/provider is a **source**.

Once an asset becomes part of a project, metadata required for deterministic authoring must not silently change because an upstream catalogue entry changes later.

S0 must explicitly answer:

* which metadata remains catalogue-owned;
* which metadata is snapshotted into the project asset record;
* which metadata belongs only to Scene placement;
* how `footprint`, placement rules and default transforms remain deterministic;
* how existing shipped catalogue IDs are preserved/migrated;
* whether built-in assets receive project-local registry rows immediately or lazily when first used;
* whether any types genuinely need a shared pure-TS home.

Do not move the whole catalogue into `@portfolio/project-model`.

P16 deliberately kept catalogue concerns out of the project-model boundary; changing that requires explicit justification.

---

# Stable identity

P20 must preserve one stable authored asset identity.

Conceptually:

```text
project
└─ asset
   ├─ assetId
   ├─ metadata
   └─ optional storage object
```

The detailed plan must inspect current `assetId` semantics before choosing:

```text
global UUID
project-local ID
(project_id, asset_id) composite identity
namespaced built-in identity
```

Prefer the smallest scheme that:

* preserves existing scene references where possible;
* avoids rewriting asset identity when storage changes;
* allows the same built-in source to be accepted by many projects independently;
* avoids collisions;
* remains compatible with future Experience consumers.

# S0 — asset contract + R2 infrastructure gate

S0 records the current code inventory and ratifies the durable contract before
the registry or R2 API starts.

**S0 status:** complete 2026-09-03, including the stale pending-save durability
re-check and session-vs-cloud divergence regression test. S1 and S2 are
implemented locally; their owner-run release gates remain below. S3 follows
live S1 smoke.

## S0 recorded inventory (opened and closed 2026-09-03)

### Current code map

| Surface | Current source / reader | S0 finding |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scene model and codec | `packages/project-model/src/scene.ts` (`SceneTextureAsset`, `SceneMaterialInstance`); `scene-codec/parse-entities.ts` (`parseTextureAsset`); `scene-codec/canonical.ts` (`canonicalDocument`); `scene-codec/parse-document.ts` (`baseTextureId` semantic check) | Canonical texture shape is exactly `{ id, name, uri }`; `uri` is required, safe root-relative, and no scene version/migration field exists. `baseTextureId` remains the scene-local texture binding. |
| URI producers | `store/texture-library-controller.svelte.ts` (`registerTexture`, `registerLocalFileTexture`); `store/material-resource-mutator.svelte.ts` (`registerVerifiedTexture`); `content/materials.ts` catalogue definitions | Current forms are arbitrary safe root-relative public paths, generated `/local/<12 lowercase hex>/<name>.<ext>`, and generated `/textures/package-<12 lowercase hex>/<name>.<ext>`. Catalogue material paths are not `SceneTextureAsset` rows. No client GLB import path exists. |
| Session resolution | `store/binary-texture-store.svelte.ts`; `texture-verifier.ts`; `museum/materials/texture-cache.ts`; `hooks/editor-shell-boot-core.ts` | Local/package bytes live only in `BinaryTextureStore`; renderer source loading checks its object URL before public fetch. Cache/load-state keys are the URI string. |
| Direct readers / UI | `museum/materials/scene-instance-material.ts`; `EditorAssetLibrary.svelte`; `EditorMaterialInspector.svelte`; `editor-textures.ts`; `EditorSceneEntities.svelte` | Material resolution converts `baseTextureId` → `texture.uri`; thumbnails use `img src={texture.uri}`; search displays/filter on name + URI; inspector displays URI/local status; scene renderer receives texture rows unchanged. |
| Export / import | `store/project-export-store.svelte.ts`; `export/package-exporter.ts`; `import/package-importer.ts`; `EditorProjectMenu.svelte`; `editor-store.svelte.ts` | Existing plain-export blocker resolves BinaryTextureStore first, blocks unregistered local/package refs, and accepts other safe URIs. Package export resolves bytes, hashes them, embeds them, and rewrites to package-local URI; package import returns URI-keyed binaries. Package filename inference reads the URI; fingerprints hash bytes, not URI. |
| Cloud persistence | `app/EditorApp.svelte` (`captureValidatedSaveSnapshot`, `submitSaveSnapshot`); `editor/project-persistence.ts`; `apps/api/src/app.ts`; `apps/api/src/project-persistence.ts` | P19 sends one validated semantic `ProjectDocument` as JSON; API stores JSONB. Before S0, cloud Save reused the plain-export blocker, so session bytes could make local/package refs appear saveable. S0 adds `projectCloudSaveBlocker` plus a final submit-boundary re-check; plain-export semantics stay separate. |
| Catalogue / visitor | `content/assets.ts`, `types/assets.ts`, `content/materials.ts`; editor and standalone museum copies of `museum/materials/scene-instance-material.ts` and `texture-cache.ts` | Catalogue metadata mixes source/provenance, placement, fallback, and runtime file paths. `/museum` and `/museum/editor` remain independent of private project assets. |

The current GLB path is catalogue-only: `AssetModel.svelte` loads checked-in
`productionFile` values and fallback models. There is no viable generic client
GLB import/placement path to reuse, so GLB stays out of P20 v1.

### S0 ownership decisions

1. **Durable reference: choose B, with an explicit logical URI contract.** Keep
   `@portfolio/project-model` unchanged and retain the backward-compatible
   `{ id, name, uri }` shape. A registry-backed texture uses
   `/project-assets/{assetId}`, where `assetId` is a server-issued opaque UUID
   in one path segment. This is a semantic project reference, not an API URL,
   R2 key, bucket path, or public fetch URL. The current safe-URI validator
   continues to validate its syntax; editor resolution intercepts this prefix.
2. `SceneTextureAsset.id` remains the scene-local texture resource ID used by
   `SceneMaterialInstance.baseTextureId`. The registry UUID is carried only by
   the logical URI. Existing IDs, catalogue model `assetId` values, and
   checked-in documents remain unchanged.
3. Static safe root-relative URIs retain their current public-resource meaning.
   `/local/...` and `/textures/package-.../...` remain session/package forms.
   Successful cloud conversion replaces either with exactly
   `/project-assets/{assetId}` after registry upload reaches `ready`.
4. Editor runtime resolution adds one app-local registry/resource resolver
   ahead of the existing texture loader. It resolves a logical URI through the
   authenticated project context, then hands bytes/object URLs to the existing
   cache. No R2 SDK or storage type enters `project-model`, `layout-core`, or
   `camera-core`; visitor-safe code never requests private registry assets.
5. Package export resolves a logical URI through its injected byte resolver,
   then emits the existing package-local URI and manifest shape. Package import
   restores the current local/package binary form and never auto-uploads.
   Plain JSON copy/download blocks logical project-asset URIs with a
   project-bound error; it never promises byte portability or rebinding.
6. Catalogue entries remain catalogue-owned. Existing shipped model IDs and
   placement/fallback behavior are preserved; no project registry row is
   created for a catalogue-only built-in. If a future accepted asset needs a
   registry row, source/provenance/license/attribution plus deterministic
   authoring metadata are snapshotted there; Scene still owns placement and
   fallback. No catalogue is moved into `@portfolio/project-model`.

### S0 cloud-save, history, guest, and storage decisions

- `projectExportBlocker` remains session-resolution/plain-export state. The
  separate `projectCloudSaveBlocker` rejects local/package URIs even when
  `BinaryTextureStore` has bytes, rejects logical project URIs until a registry
  resolver proves `ready`, and accepts safe static URIs. `EditorApp` uses only
  the cloud blocker for semantic Save; the final submit boundary re-checks
  stale/resumed payloads. Targeted tests pin both predicates.
- Conversion is one undoable scene transaction after upload is `ready`. Failed
  document mutation leaves the ready asset unreferenced; failed project Save
  leaves the durable reference dirty and retryable without re-upload. Undoing
  conversion restores a local/package URI and therefore restores the cloud
  Save block. No automatic fallback or silent byte loss.
- Guest behavior chooses **A — authenticated conversion only**. OAuth never
  claims in-memory bytes survive. A guest with local bytes exports a portable
  package, authenticates, re-imports, then explicitly converts/uploads. No
  anonymous user, temporary server row, or anonymous R2 object.
- Registry IDs are server-generated UUIDs. R2 keys use deterministic project
  namespace plus opaque suffix:
  `projects/{projectId}/assets/{assetId}/{opaqueSuffix}`. Client never supplies
  keys; private byte GET repeats session → owned project → asset authorization.
  P20 v1 computes SHA-256 for integrity, does no deduplication, and ships no
  remove/delete/GC operation. Ready rows require validated metadata and a
  successful object; failed PUT marks `failed`, while PUT-success/finalize-
  failure stays `pending` and is never returned as usable.
- v1 upload bound is 25 MiB. Accepted classes are PNG, WebP, and JPEG only;
  server-side magic-byte sniffing is authoritative over client MIME/size/SHA.
  Filename is display metadata only: NFC-normalized, basename-only, bounded,
  and never used as an object key. API-local validation may reuse the existing
  magic-byte rules without importing editor code.
- R2 uses the S3-compatible API through `apps/api`; no generic workspace
  storage package or second backend. Production names are server-only
  `R2_ENDPOINT`, `R2_BUCKET`, `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, and
  `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`; local tests inject a deterministic in-memory store.
  Cloudflare account/bucket, location, Render secret values, and live smoke
  remain owner-run and are not fabricated in source.

## Required code inventory

Record the known baseline directly instead of re-investigating it:

```text
SceneTextureAsset = { id, name, uri }

scene codec
→ safe root-relative URI validation

projectExportBlocker
→ BinaryTextureStore first
→ package/local URI without bytes blocked
→ safe static URI otherwise resolved

package exporter
→ resolve texture bytes
→ fingerprint
→ embed bytes
→ rewrite to package-local /textures/... URI
```

Then focus investigation only on the actual unanswered questions:

1. exact current texture URI forms and all producers;
2. every `SceneTextureAsset.uri` reader, including the renderer loader, direct DOM thumbnails, search/filter text, load-state/cache keys, inspector display, fingerprinting and package export;
3. the separate cloud-Save durability predicate that rejects local/package forms even when `BinaryTextureStore` has their bytes;
4. how a registry-backed texture can enter the resolution path without R2 semantics entering project-model;
5. schema/backward-compatibility implications of durable references;
6. package export after cloud conversion;
7. package import → local binary → optional cloud conversion;
8. plain-JSON export/import semantics for registry-backed references — block, warn as project-bound, or define rebinding; do not imply byte portability;
9. history semantics when replacing a local reference with a durable one;
10. current GLB import/placement maturity;
11. guest-local binary → OAuth → authenticated upload behavior.

The detailed plan must cite exact files/functions for these decisions.

Do not implement against assumptions from old plans if current code differs.

## R2 owner-run gate

S0 pins the local/API contract below; owner-run Cloudflare account, bucket,
credential, Render-secret, and live-smoke provisioning remains pending and is
the S1 release gate.

Pin:

* Cloudflare account;
* one private R2 bucket for project asset bytes;
* bucket location hint/access geography appropriate to Render/Neon users;
* API credentials;
* Render secrets/environment names;
* local-development strategy;
* upload limits;
* supported initial MIME/file classes — v1 is `image/png`, `image/webp`, `image/jpeg` using existing image support; GLB conditional (see v1 scope); no audio/video pipelines.

Consume R2 through its S3-compatible API.

Do not add a generic object-storage abstraction unless a concrete second backend already exists.

## Pin lifecycle semantics

S0 ratifies the following lifecycle:

```text
register
upload
resolve
reference
Save
Load
download/fetch
```

including failure behavior:

* **register:** an authenticated owned project creates a server-issued UUID
  row in `pending` state; the client supplies display metadata and bytes, never
  an asset ID or object key.
* **upload:** the API validates size, magic-byte MIME, and SHA-256, writes the
  object under the server-owned project namespace, then finalizes metadata.
* **resolve:** metadata and byte reads require the same session → owned-project
  check; only `ready` rows may resolve to the editor.
* **reference:** the scene stores only `/project-assets/{assetId}` after a
  successful upload; local/package references remain session/package forms.
* **Save / Load:** semantic JSONB Save accepts only durable static or ready
  project references; Load returns the logical reference and the editor
  resolves bytes through the authenticated asset endpoint.
* **download/fetch:** private API byte fetch, never a public R2 URL; package
  export injects resolved bytes and keeps its existing embedded-byte contract.
* **failure:** failed validation or PUT marks the row `failed`; a successful
  PUT followed by finalize failure remains `pending` and is never usable.
  P20 ships no delete, GC, or orphan cleanup operation.

S1 implementation must preserve these pinned constraints:

* R2 key format — deterministic **project namespace**, server-owned opaque object identity: `projects/{projectId}/assets/{assetId}/{opaque-suffix}`. Do not make the full object key deterministic: the namespace is deterministic, the final storage identifier is opaque. Hard rules: client never supplies the R2 key; key is always project-scoped; asset ID must be authorized against that project; raw object key is never sufficient authorization; byte GET repeats the same session → project ownership check as metadata GET; bucket remains private; no guessable/public R2 URLs as the normal contract;
* SHA-256 integrity;
* duplicate-byte behavior — if SHA-256 dedup ships, scope it to the project (`(project_id, sha256)` or equivalent); no cross-user/cross-project dedup in P20 (avoids existence inference, ownership leakage, and coupled retention). Dedup may be deferred entirely; integrity hashing alone suffices for v1;
* metadata/object creation order;
* orphan-object cleanup;
* what happens when DB metadata exists but the R2 object is missing;
* failed/pending upload retention and later cleanup; physical and logical deletion do not ship in P20.

# Guest boundary

Guest authoring remains first-class.

Guest users may continue to use existing built-in/local authoring functionality and portable export according to current behavior.

But:

```text
R2 persistence
registry-backed cloud asset ownership
→ require authenticated owned project
```

No anonymous R2 objects.

No temporary server-side guest accounts.

## Guest local-binary → cloud transition

P19.4's OAuth handoff intentionally persists only semantic `ProjectDocument`; it does not persist arbitrary binary bytes across the full-page Google redirect.

P20 must explicitly resolve this edge case before changing the current Save blocker:

```text
guest has local binary
→ requests cloud Save
→ authentication navigation would lose in-memory bytes
```

The detailed plan must choose one bounded v1 behavior.

Preferred priority:

1. preserve current local/portable behavior;
2. do not invent anonymous R2 storage;
3. do not silently lose bytes;
4. do not weaken `projectExportBlocker`.

Acceptable v1 directions include:

### A — authenticated conversion only

Require authentication before converting local binary assets into cloud assets. If a guest already has local bytes, require a portable package export before OAuth and package re-import after authentication; only then offer explicit cloud conversion. Never navigate to OAuth while claiming the in-memory bytes will survive.

### B — bounded browser handoff

Persist only the required unresolved asset bytes into a short-lived browser-local binary handoff specifically for the OAuth transition, then upload after authentication.

If B materially expands P20 into an IndexedDB/offline subsystem, reject it and keep A.

S0 chooses **A — authenticated conversion only**; this guest-binary contract
and the cloud-Save durability gate are closed entry blockers for S1.

Do not hide this behavior inside ad-hoc session storage or silently discard local binary state.

---

# S1 — registry database + R2 API

**Owner shorthand:** P20.1. **Brief ready:** 2026-09-03. **Local
implementation:** complete 2026-09-03. **Entry/release gate:** P19 live/ready
authenticated Save–Load smoke (passed 2026-09-03) plus owner-provisioned
private R2 bucket and Render secrets.

## Outcome and boundary

Authenticated owner can register one project texture, stream PNG/WebP/JPEG
bytes into private R2, list/read metadata, and fetch through authorized API.
Stable server UUID survives; failed upload never becomes `ready`.

S1 is API infrastructure only. It does not add editor UI, mutate
`SceneDocument`, create `/project-assets/{assetId}` references, relax S0's
cloud-Save blocker, resolve runtime textures, or change package export. Those
belong to S2–S4. No GLB, delete/GC, dedup, presigned URLs, multipart/resumable
flow, workers, CDN, transcoding, ORM, or generic storage package.

## Existing seams to reuse

- `app.ts`: `createApp`, session, generic 404, origin/error/logging patterns.
- `project-persistence.ts` + `database.ts`: parameterized SQL, row readers,
  transactions, `ProjectNotFoundError`, `DatabasePool` / `DatabaseClient`.
  Put asset SQL in sibling `asset-persistence.ts`; no ORM/model widening.
- `config.ts` + `server.ts`: env validation and composition-time injection.
- `migrate.ts`: ordered forward-only runner; add `002-project-assets.sql`.
- Existing image rules: PNG 8-byte signature, WebP `RIFF....WEBP`, JPEG
  `FF D8 FF`. Copy this tiny pure check API-locally; never import editor code.
- Existing integrity spelling: lowercase `sha256-<64 hex>`.

## Literal migration

`apps/api/migrations/002-project-assets.sql`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS assets (
	id uuid PRIMARY KEY,
	project_id text NOT NULL REFERENCES projects(id),
	name text NOT NULL CHECK (
		char_length(name) BETWEEN 1 AND 128 AND name = btrim(name)
		AND position('/' in name) = 0 AND position(chr(92) in name) = 0
	),
	kind text NOT NULL CHECK (kind IN ('texture', 'procedural')),
	storage_kind text NOT NULL CHECK (storage_kind IN ('r2', 'none')),
	source_kind text NOT NULL CHECK (source_kind IN ('upload', 'builtin', 'procedural')),
	source_ref text,
	mime text CHECK (mime IN ('image/png', 'image/webp', 'image/jpeg')),
	byte_size bigint CHECK (byte_size BETWEEN 1 AND 26214400),
	sha256 text CHECK (sha256 ~ '^sha256-[0-9a-f]{64}$'),
	object_key text UNIQUE,
	import_state text NOT NULL CHECK (import_state IN ('pending', 'ready', 'failed')),
	created_at timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
	updated_at timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
	CHECK (
		(storage_kind = 'r2' AND object_key IS NOT NULL AND source_kind = 'upload')
		OR (storage_kind = 'none' AND object_key IS NULL
			AND source_kind IN ('builtin', 'procedural'))
	),
	CHECK (storage_kind = 'r2' OR import_state = 'ready'),
	CHECK (import_state <> 'ready' OR storage_kind = 'none'
		OR (mime IS NOT NULL AND byte_size IS NOT NULL AND sha256 IS NOT NULL))
);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS assets_project_created_at_idx
	ON assets (project_id, created_at DESC, id ASC);
```

App validation additionally requires NFC-normalized names. API-created rows
are exactly `kind='texture'`, `storage_kind='r2'`, `source_kind='upload'`.
`none` rows only preserve built-in/procedural schema viability; S1 adds no
route that creates them. Node `crypto.randomUUID()` creates `id`; Node
`randomBytes()` creates opaque key suffix. No Postgres extension.

## HTTP contract

Route-level `onRequest` requires valid session before body parsing. Every query
filters through `projects.owner_id`; unknown/foreign IDs return identical
`404 { error: { code: 'not_found', message: 'Not Found' } }`. Client never
sends owner/asset ID, object key, bucket, checksum, size, or final MIME.

| Method | Route | Request | Success |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/projects/:projectId/assets` | none | `200 { assets: AssetMetadata[] }`, newest first |
| `POST` | `/projects/:projectId/assets` | JSON `{ name }` only | `201 AssetMetadata` in `pending` state |
| `GET` | `/projects/:projectId/assets/:assetId` | none | `200 AssetMetadata`, any state |
| `PUT` | `/projects/:projectId/assets/:assetId/content` | raw `application/octet-stream`; required `Content-Length` | `200 AssetMetadata` in `ready` state |
| `GET` | `/projects/:projectId/assets/:assetId/content` | none | `200` streamed bytes with sniffed `Content-Type`, DB `Content-Length`, `Cache-Control: private, no-store` |

`AssetMetadata` contains `id`, `projectId`, `name`, `kind`, `storageKind`,
`sourceKind`, `sourceRef`, `mime`, `byteSize`, `sha256`, `importState`,
`createdAt`, and `updatedAt`. It never contains `objectKey` or a storage URL.

Validation/errors:

- malformed UUID/project ID (`[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._:-]*`) or name/body:
  `400 invalid_asset`;
- missing length: `411 length_required`; zero/mismatched length: `400 invalid_upload`;
- declared or observed body above 25 MiB: `413 payload_too_large`;
- wrong request content type or unsupported magic bytes: `415 unsupported_media_type`;
- upload to `ready`, or byte GET before `ready`: `409 asset_not_ready`;
- DB/R2 failure, missing ready object, or R2 length mismatch: `503 service_unavailable`.

Broaden current origin guard to all unsafe browser methods (`POST`, `PUT`,
`PATCH`, `DELETE`), not only project `PUT` and logout. `GET`, `HEAD`, and OIDC
callback remain safe-method paths. Register one `application/octet-stream`
content parser returning request stream; size enforcement stays in streaming
pipeline so binary requests do not inherit P19's 2 MiB JSON limit.

## Persistence and upload order

`POST` performs one `INSERT ... SELECT` from owned `projects`; zero returned
rows means generic 404. It allocates:

```text
assetId = crypto.randomUUID()
objectKey = projects/{projectId}/assets/{assetId}/{random opaque suffix}
state = pending
```

`PUT` does:

```text
authenticate before consuming body
→ read owned pending/failed asset
→ atomically replace object key with per-attempt opaque claim; set pending
→ read at most 12 prefix bytes and sniff MIME
→ stream prefix + remainder through byte counter + createHash('sha256')
→ objectStore.put(key, stream, sniffed MIME, declared length)
→ require observed length = Content-Length and ≤ 25 MiB
→ conditionally UPDATE matching claim to ready with MIME/size/SHA
```

No DB transaction spans client/R2 streaming. Object key doubles as claim token;
concurrent attempts use distinct keys, and only latest matching claim can
finalize. Leave implementation note:
`// ponytail: object key doubles as upload claim; superseded bytes stay orphaned until GC ships.`

Validation/stream/store failure marks matching claim `failed`; retry reuses
asset ID with new key. PUT success plus finalize failure leaves `pending`;
retained object is not served. No cleanup/delete.

`GET .../content` authorizes and loads `ready` metadata before calling object
storage. Missing object/size mismatch returns 503 without mutation; mid-stream
failure terminates response and logs safe metadata only. Do not hash each read.

## Object-store seam and dependency

Add API-local `object-store.ts` only:

```ts
import type { Readable } from 'node:stream';

type ObjectStore = {
	put(key: string, body: Readable,
		options: { contentType: string; contentLength: number }): Promise<void>;
	get(key: string): Promise<{ body: Readable; contentLength: number } | null>;
	close?(): void;
};
```

`createApp` receives this interface. Tests inject deterministic memory/failure
stores. Production `server.ts` constructs `S3Client` with `region: 'auto'`,
configured endpoint/credentials, and `PutObjectCommand` / `GetObjectCommand`.
Add only `@aws-sdk/client-s3`; no `lib-storage`. `onClose` destroys S3 client
once alongside pool closure.

Add required config: `R2_ENDPOINT` (credential-free HTTPS URL), `R2_BUCKET`,
`R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`. Values stay server-only and never
enter logs/responses. `npm run test:api` supplies fake store and makes zero
network calls.

## App/editor lifecycle semantics

No Svelte mount, unmount, selection, placement, transform, or history change.
API owns one object-store adapter for process lifetime and closes it on Fastify
shutdown. S2 owns editor registry state; S3 owns undoable URI replacement.

## Exact acceptance

Add focused cases to `apps/api/tests/api.test.mjs`:

1. migration runner applies 002 once; Neon smoke proves `none` rows pass and
   incomplete `ready` R2 rows fail;
2. every asset route rejects missing/invalid session before DB or store calls;
3. owner register/list/read works; malformed inputs fail; foreign metadata,
   upload, and bytes share same 404;
4. server generates IDs/keys under project namespace; key never enters JSON;
5. multi-chunk PNG/WebP/JPEG records exact MIME, size, `sha256-<hex>`;
6. missing/zero/false/oversized length, length mismatch, wrong content type,
   bad magic, client abort, and store PUT failure never produce `ready`;
7. concurrent PUTs serialize; second sees `ready`; failed/pending retry same ID;
8. finalize failure leaves `pending` while fake store retains object;
9. ready bytes stream with expected headers; pending/failed do not call store;
   missing object/size mismatch return 503; stream failure is bounded;
10. foreign byte request rejects before store GET;
11. config errors redact secrets; shutdown closes store once;
12. existing auth/project/CORS/2 MiB tests remain green.

Run:

```text
npm run check:api
npm run test:api
npm run build:api
npm run verify:visitor-bundle
```

After owner gate, manual smoke: register → upload one PNG → list/read → fetch
and byte-compare; repeat fetch under second user and confirm generic 404; force
bad MIME and >25 MiB and confirm no ready asset. Never use production
credentials in automated tests.

**Owner-run result (2026-09-04, local stack):** 15/15 PASS against local API +
local Postgres + real R2 — register → PNG upload → list/read → byte-identical
fetch (`image/png`, `private, no-store`); second-user metadata/bytes `404`/`404`;
bad magic `415` (row → `failed`); oversized declared length `413`; no
`objectKey` in any metadata. The smoke exposed Postgres `42702` (unqualified
`RETURNING` in `UPDATE … FROM projects p`); fixed by qualifying with `a.` for
the two updates while the INSERT keeps unqualified names (no alias in scope).

## Relic, visitor, and rollback

`/museum` and `/museum/editor` receive no imports, routes, registry state, or
private requests. `@portfolio/project-model`, `@portfolio/layout-core`, and
`@portfolio/camera-core` receive no server/storage dependency. Plan/Camera,
navigation, scene schema, and visitor bundle stay unchanged.

If S1 expands, land two reviewable groups: (A) migration + direct SQL + routes
against fake store; (B) R2 adapter + config + owner smoke. Do not deploy A
alone. Existing migration runner is forward-only; rollback means stop deploy
and leave unused `assets` table, never destructive down-migration.

# S2 — Spatial registry integration

**Owner shorthand:** P20.2. **Brief ready / local implementation complete:** 2026-09-03 —
[Spatial registry integration slice brief](2026-09-03-P20.2-spatial-registry-integration.md).
**Entry gate:** P19 live/ready authenticated Save–Load smoke (passed 2026-09-03) plus P20.1 private-R2
authenticated smoke.

Integrate the registry into the **existing Spatial asset system**.

Do not build the final project-level Assets workspace yet.

The existing asset library becomes progressively a contextual view over:

```text
built-in catalogue
+
current project's accepted registry assets
```

with one placement path after acceptance.

Minimum workflow:

```text
choose/import asset
→ register/upload if required
→ receive stable assetId
→ existing Spatial placement
→ existing selection/history/transforms
```

Do not create a second placement command set for cloud assets.

## Built-in assets

Existing built-ins must keep working without R2.

When a built-in is used in a cloud project, the detailed plan determines whether its project registry metadata is:

```text
created on first use
```

or:

```text
derived until first durable Save
```

but the result must preserve provenance and deterministic authoring semantics.

## Uploaded assets

Uploaded assets become:

```text
file
→ validation
→ registry ingest
→ R2
→ stable project asset identity
→ normal Spatial use
```

P20 does not require a polished import wizard.

Use the smallest existing asset-library UI seam.

## Online assets

Provider architecture remains future-compatible but provider search itself is not required.

If existing assets already carry provider/source URLs, preserve them as provenance.

Do not hard-code Sketchfab into the durable registry model.

---

# S3 — resolve current binary Save blockers

**Owner shorthand:** P20.3. **Brief / local implementation complete:** 2026-09-03 —
[Texture durable-conversion slice brief](2026-09-03-P20.3-texture-durable-conversion.md).
**Entry gate:** P19 live/ready authenticated Save–Load smoke (passed 2026-09-03) plus P20.1
private-R2 authenticated smoke. P20.2 is implemented locally.

P20 should make the first real cloud fidelity improvement by converting currently unresolved file-backed project resources into registry-backed durable assets.

Start with the actual cloud-durability hole, especially local/package texture bytes that are present in `BinaryTextureStore` and therefore pass the current session-resolution blocker.

Current shape:

```text
ProjectDocument
→ local/package texture reference
→ BinaryTextureStore
→ session-resolution `projectExportBlocker`
→ cloud Save currently passes while session bytes exist
→ durable Load fails after refresh
```

S0 adds the separate cloud-Save durability gate before this slice proceeds.

Target:

```text
local texture
→ registry ingest
→ R2 upload
→ durable asset reference
→ blocker clears for that asset
→ P19 Save
```

Do not repurpose or globally relax `projectExportBlocker`.

The cloud-Save durability blocker clears only after the corresponding asset is provably durable and resolvable.

The detailed plan must pin:

* which current URI forms can be migrated;
* what durable reference replaces them;
* whether document replacement is undoable;
* what happens if upload succeeds but semantic document mutation fails;
* what happens if mutation succeeds but later project Save fails;
* retry semantics;
* how portable package export continues to behave.

## Save remains atomic

Keep the existing sequencing principle:

```text
upload/resolve asset first
→ ProjectDocument points at durable asset
→ normal P19 whole-project Save
```

Do not persist:

```text
pending-upload URI
blob:
temporary object URL
/local/...
fake cloud reference
```

into durable cloud project truth.

## Portable package semantics

Portable packages remain portable. A registry-backed cloud texture exported as a portable package is resolved to bytes and embedded using the existing package manifest/rewrite model:

```text
cloud project asset
→ authorized asset resolver
→ bytes
→ existing package exporter
→ embedded texture
→ package-local URI
```

Do not emit R2 URLs, authenticated API URLs, or project-registry lookup dependencies into an exported package. Portable export must not require access to the original user's authenticated cloud project after export. Missing bytes at export time fail closed with a clear error.

Package import restores its current package/local binary form. It does not automatically upload imported bytes to R2; cloud conversion remains an explicit later action.

Plain JSON does not embed bytes. S0 must explicitly choose whether registry-backed references are blocked, exported with a project-bound warning, or rebound on import. Only package export promises byte portability.

---

# S4 — Load/runtime resolution + deployment smoke

**Owner shorthand:** P20.4. **Implemented locally:** 2026-09-04 —
[Load/runtime asset-resolution slice brief](2026-09-03-P20.4-load-runtime-resolution.md).
**Entry gate:** owner-run P20.1 private-R2 authenticated smoke. P20.2 and P20.3
are implemented locally.

A cloud project must survive the complete persistence round trip.

On Load:

```text
ProjectDocument
→ stable asset reference
→ project registry lookup/resolution
→ R2 bytes when applicable
→ existing renderer/loader
```

Do not create a new scene renderer.

Do not let R2 storage semantics leak into `AssetModel` callers unnecessarily; add the smallest resolution seam around the current loader.

## Required smoke

At minimum:

```text
authenticate
→ create project
→ ingest local texture
→ upload/register
→ use it in authored scene/material
→ Save project
→ refresh
→ Load project
→ resolve registry asset
→ fetch R2 bytes
→ render successfully
```

If current GLB import is sufficiently implemented and does not require a new subsystem, also prove:

```text
upload GLB
→ register
→ place
→ Save
→ refresh
→ Load
→ fetch
→ render
```

Do not expand P20 merely to make the second smoke possible.

**Owner-run result (2026-09-04, local stack):** browser round-trip passed —
Cloud-file import → Save v9 (logical URI only, no bytes/keys in JSON) →
refresh (blank boot, no auto-load) → explicit Load (registry bytes hydrated,
`blob:` thumbnails, project clean, no history) → re-Save v10 with no re-upload
(asset count unchanged) → unauthenticated byte GET `401` → package export
embeds byte-identical PNG under a package-local URI with no R2/API-URL
leakage (manifest SHA matches the R2 SHA).

# Asset deletion and immutable project versions

P19 stores immutable historical `project_versions`.

Therefore physical asset deletion is not equivalent to deleting an item from the current UI.

An older project version may still reference the binary.

P20 must not:

```text
delete registry record / R2 bytes
because current latest document no longer references it
```

unless historical version semantics have been accounted for.

P20 v1 ships neither logical remove/archive nor physical deletion. Assets remain in the project registry even when the latest document stops referencing them. Defer both active-list lifecycle and unreferenced-object GC until a real consumer and reference/version retention semantics justify them.

---

# Security and validation

P20 must explicitly pin:

* upload maximum bytes;
* allowed initial MIME/file types — v1 is `image/png`, `image/webp`, `image/jpeg`;
* filename normalization;
* server-side MIME sniffing/validation using existing helpers where compatible (confirm magic-byte sniffing vs extension mapping; never trust the browser's declared MIME alone);
* SHA-256 computation;
* object-key generation;
* path/key injection prevention;
* authenticated project ownership before asset exposure;
* bounded errors;
* request timeout behavior;
* logging redaction;
* R2 credentials server-only;
* no arbitrary bucket/object access supplied by clients.

Do not trust:

```text
client MIME
client size
client SHA
client R2 key
client project owner
```

without server validation.

---

# Project Shell relationship

P19.4 already established:

```text
Project Shell
└─ Spatial
```

P20 does **not** need the final Assets surface design.

The shell may remain:

```text
Project Shell
└─ Spatial
```

while asset management stays contextual inside the existing Spatial library.

If a minimal `/project/[id]/assets` route becomes clearly useful during implementation, treat it only as a thin project-asset management surface over the same registry.

Do not create a second asset store to support that route.

Do not delay P20 for final Project Shell visual design.

---

# Visitor and relic boundaries

Hard rules:

## `/museum`

* remains read-only visitor;
* does not authenticate;
* does not list private project assets;
* does not receive R2 management credentials or editor APIs;
* does not consume the Project Asset Registry as an editor service.

The existing checked-in museum assets continue to work independently.

## `/museum/editor`

* remains frozen relic behavior;
* does not adopt cloud asset management as cleanup;
* does not mount P20 registry state/controller unless a separate explicit relic decision is made.

Do not use P20 to merge visitor/editor asset infrastructure.

Shared pure utilities are acceptable where they remain visitor-safe.

---

# Acceptance

## Registry / database

1. An authenticated user can create/list/read assets only inside owned projects.
2. A second user cannot discover or access another user's project assets.
3. Built-in/procedural records can exist without R2 object keys.
4. File-backed assets record stable metadata and integrity information.
5. No scene/layout entities are normalized into the asset tables.
6. Applying P20 migration through the existing migration runner is idempotent.

## R2

7. Heavy bytes upload successfully without whole-file API buffering.
8. Failed upload cannot produce a registry asset reported as ready.
9. Stored bytes can be fetched only through the authorized project asset path chosen by the plan; byte GET repeats the same session → project ownership check as metadata GET, and a second user cannot fetch another user's bytes.
10. R2 credentials/object keys never enter authored project JSON as storage authority.

## Object-store seam and portability

33. `npm run test:api` covers upload success, object-store failure, missing object, stream/read failure, pending/failed/finalize behavior, and ownership rejection before bytes are exposed — without contacting Cloudflare.
34. Portable export of a registry-backed texture embeds resolved bytes via the existing package manifest/rewrite model; exported packages carry no R2/API URLs and require no authenticated cloud access.
35. Shared-package purity guard remains green: no R2/S3/Fastify/pg/Node-storage imports in `@portfolio/project-model`, `@portfolio/layout-core`, or `@portfolio/camera-core`.

## Spatial

11. Existing built-in catalogue assets still place/render through existing commands.
12. Registry-backed assets use the same selection, placement, transforms, history and renderer pathways after acceptance.
13. No parallel Spatial/cloud placement system appears.
14. Catalogue metadata and registry metadata have one explicitly documented ownership boundary.

## Save/Load

15. A local/package texture URI blocks cloud Save until durable conversion succeeds, even while `BinaryTextureStore` still holds its bytes.
16. Uploading/converting that asset replaces the unresolved reference with the canonical durable reference.
17. Normal P19 whole-project Save then succeeds.
18. Refresh + explicit Load restores the same semantic project.
19. Asset bytes resolve again from R2 and render/use successfully.
20. Asset upload failure cannot reset project Save dirty baselines.

## Guest/auth

21. Guest authoring still requires no account.
22. Guest activity creates no DB user/project/R2 object merely by opening the editor.
23. Cloud asset persistence requires authenticated project ownership.
24. The unresolved guest-binary/OAuth edge follows the explicit S0 contract and never silently loses bytes.

## Regression

25. Existing plain JSON and package export remain supported; S0 explicitly pins block, project-bound warning, or rebinding semantics for registry references, while only packages promise portable bytes.
26. `LayoutDocument` / `SceneDocument` ownership remains unchanged.
27. camera/navigation systems remain unchanged.
28. selection/history remains deterministic and editor-owned.
29. `/museum` makes no private project-asset/auth request.
30. `/museum/editor` retains relic behavior.
31. visitor-bundle boundary checks remain green.
32. API/editor/project persistence tests and builds remain green.

# Internal delivery structure

Use one umbrella P-number:

```text
P20 — Project Asset Registry + R2
```

with internal slices (never registered as separate tracker rows; S-names avoid confusion with the tracker's flat P-number namespace):

```text
S0
Asset ownership + durable-reference gate + cloud-Save durability + guest-binary + R2 gate

S1
Postgres registry + R2 client + authenticated API + test seam

S2
Spatial ingest / built-in + upload registry integration

S3
Texture/local-binary durable conversion + Save blocker integration + portable export

S4
Load resolution + deployed end-to-end fidelity smoke
```

Do not register each internal slice as a new P-number.

If code inventory proves two adjacent slices are mechanically inseparable, merge them rather than preserving this numbering artificially.

---

# Close condition

P20 ships when this statement is true:

> An authenticated project can own a durable file-backed texture asset (PNG/WebP/JPEG), Spatial can use it through the existing authoring system, P19 can Save a semantic reference to it, and after refresh + Load the same bytes resolve from R2 and the project renders correctly.

That is the P20 product boundary.

P20 does not need Experience, Publish, final Assets UI, provider search, or asset-processing infrastructure to close.
